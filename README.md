Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains a mixture of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available at [insert link to dataset]. It contains the following columns:

Time: The time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset (in seconds).
V1-V28: Anonymized features resulting from a PCA transformation to protect sensitive information.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: The target variable, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate one.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the credit_card_fraud_detection.py script to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
Modify the script as needed for experimentation with different models, parameters, or data preprocessing techniques.
